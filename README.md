# Fund Analysis Database Project
## COSC 61: Database Systems

The project seeks to create a well-designed database from the large dataset of fund performances. After creating this database, it will be analyzed to answer the research questions outlined in the [Dataset](Dataset.md) page.

The entity relationship diagram can be found in the [ERD](ERD.md) page and the build plan for the database can be found in the [Database Build Plan](Database_Build_Plan.md) page.
