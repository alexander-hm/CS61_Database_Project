# Fund Analysis Database Project ðŸ“Š

## Description
The Fund Analysis Database Project is a culminating project in the COSC 61: Database course at Dartmouth College. The purpose of this project is to leverage a vast dataset of fund performances and transform it into a comprehensible database. After constructing an efficient and well-structured database, it is used to answer specific research questions related to the dataset.

## Process Overview
1. **Dataset Exploration**: The project begins with a deep dive into the dataset's details, understanding its source, structure, and the research questions it aims to address.
2. **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**: This step involves visualizing the relationships between different entities in the dataset, forming the foundation of the database design.
3. **Database Build Plan**: A comprehensive roadmap is laid out for constructing the database. This plan details the step-by-step procedures and considerations taken during the building phase.
4. **Database Implementation**: This phase witnesses the actual execution of the build plan, highlighting any challenges encountered and the solutions employed to overcome them.
5. **Schema Definition**: A detailed breakdown of the database's structure is provided, including the fields, data types, and relationships of each table.
6. **Research Analysis**: The dataset is then used to answer specific research questions. This section includes the results of these queries and a description of the findings.
7. **Database Enhancement**: The database undergoes enhancements using Python for data visualization and data analysis.

## Highlights
- **Objective**: The project aims to analyze fund performances and extract meaningful insights using an efficiently designed database.
- **Tools and Technologies**: The database management system (DBMS) used is MySQL, with data modeling done using MySQL Workbench 8.0. Python plays a crucial role in enhancing the database, especially for data visualization and analysis. Additionally, tools like Kaggle are also employed.
- **Contributors**: The project is spearheaded by Alexander Huang-Menders.
